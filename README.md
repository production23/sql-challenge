# SQL Project Overview

## Introduction
This SQL project involves working with multiple CSV files containing employee and department data. 
The project is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. 

### Data Modeling
- Inspect the CSV files and sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to represent the tables.
- Identify primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints for each table.

### Data Engineering
- Create table schemas for each CSV file, specifying data types, primary keys, and foreign keys.
- Import data from the CSV files into their corresponding SQL tables.

### Data Analysis
- Perform various SQL queries to extract insights from the data.

## Data Analysis Queries
1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. List the first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

## Usage
- **Data Analysis**: Run SQL queries to extract insights from the data.

## Dependencies
- PostgreSQL database management system
